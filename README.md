# Predictive Software Maintenance System (PSMS)

## Introduction
The Predictive Software Maintenance System (PSMS) leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to anticipate and address potential software issues before they impact system performance. By analyzing historical data and identifying patterns that precede failures, PSMS aims to transform the reactive nature of software maintenance into a proactive and predictive strategy.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous observation of software performance to instantly detect anomalies.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Utilization of machine learning models to forecast potential issues and maintenance needs.
- **Automated Alerts**: Immediate notification system for maintenance teams upon detection of potential problems.
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient allocation of maintenance resources based on predictive insights.
